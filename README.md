# Data Structures in C

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures in C, as part of my university course. It's a work in progress, and I'll be adding new structures and refining existing ones as I learn more.

## Class 1: Remembering C

This section contains introductory exercises to refresh basic C programming concepts.

*   `ascii_table.c`: A simple program to print the ASCII table.
*   `exercicios_aula1.c`: A collection of exercises from the first class. // Note that this file is in portuguese and I am too lazy to translate. It is not important though, as it's not a Data Structure.

## Class 2: Remembering Archives and Pointers

This section focuses on file manipulation and pointers.

*   `archives.c`: Exercises involving file I/O operations.
*   `arraysorting.c`: A program that sorts an array, demonstrating pointer usage.
*   `file.txt`: A sample text file for the file I/O exercises.

## Class 3: `malloc`

This section introduces dynamic memory allocation.

*   `memory_allocation.c`: Exercises demonstrating the use of `malloc` and `free`.

## Class 4: ArrayList

This section contains an implementation of a dynamic array (ArrayList).

*   `arraylist.c`: The source code for the ArrayList implementation.

## Class 5: Linked List

This section contains an implementation of a linked list.

*   `linked_list.c`: The source code for the Linked List implementation.

## Class 6: Circular List and Sorted List

This section contains implementations of a circular list and a sorted list.

*   `circular_list.c`: The source code for the Circular List implementation.
*   `sorted_list.c`: The source code for the Sorted List implementation.

## Future Implementations

I plan to implement the following data structures:

*   Double Linked List
*   Stacks
*   Queues
*   Trees (Binary, AVL, etc.)
*   Hash Tables
*   Graphs

... and more!
